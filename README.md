# Image-Caption-Generator

This project basically requires both the concept of ML and DL, and also in the neural network layer it uses  all the concept of CNN for understanding the image, RNN and LSTM for generating the caption.

It basically uses the Flickr8K dataset which is generally a dataset of 8000 images and 5 caption of each image on which are network get's trained. There are big outliers out in this like, tiger is been named as cat in the caption, as the 8k dataset dosen't provide that much range of images.

Being said that the code/network tries it best to be able to achieve certain amount of accuracy, but also if you want to increase the accuracy then you need to improve the quality of dataset.
